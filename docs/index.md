# Netbox Provider

The Terraform Netbox provider is a plugin for Terraform that allows for the full lifecycle management of [Netbox](https://netbox.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) resources.

Each resource's `id` (unless otherwise specified) is computed by the resource and should not be specified for resource creation. These IDs are critical for relating different resource objects to each other - a common pattern is creating a resource / retrieving a datasource for a type of Netbox object, then using that object's id for creation in a subsequent resource (see example below)


## Example Usage

```hcl
provider "netbox" {
    server_url           = var.netbox_server
    api_token            = var.netbox_api_token
    allow_insecure_https = false
}

data "netbox_platform" "testplatform" {
    name = "my-test-platform"
}

resource "netbox_cluster_type" "testclustertype" {
    name = "my-test-cluster-type"
}

resource "netbox_cluster" "testcluster" {
    name = "my-test-cluster"
    cluster_type_id = netbox_cluster_type.testclustertype.id
}

resource "netbox_virtual_machine" "testvm" {
    name = "my-test-vm"
    cluster_id = netbox_cluster.testcluster.id
    platform_id = data.netbox_platform.testplatform.id
}
```
